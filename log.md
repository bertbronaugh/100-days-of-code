# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: December 24, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Cloned the 100 Days of Code repo over to my Tyler personal profile. Set up basic projects for the IncHelpParser and BrazosNewWorldDataComparison repos. Getting the IncHelp project going on VS2019, which included the Python extension. Got the basic Hello World example for tkinter going. (https://wiki.python.org/moin/TkInter)

**Thoughts:** It's easy to want to spend time setting up project boards and such when I just really need to stop and actually code something. Also, tkinter seems convenient, but maybe not the easiest to start with as far as a GUI. I might try something else later.

### Day 2: December 25

**Today's Progress**: Started connecting the GUI to the parser program. Figuring out not only how to import a module, but actually get it to run. Need to keep appending self. to functions and adding self as the first parameter of said functions.

**Thoughts**: Python classes/functions keep passing self in. I guess it doesn't want to be left out of anything. Also, these were helpful: [Digital Ocean link on modules](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-write-modules-in-python-3) and [Type Error](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18884782/typeerror-worker-takes-0-positional-arguments-but-1-was-given)
