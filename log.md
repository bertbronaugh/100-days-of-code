# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: December 24, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Cloned the 100 Days of Code repo over to my Tyler personal profile. Set up basic projects for the IncHelpParser and BrazosNewWorldDataComparison repos. Getting the IncHelp project going on VS2019, which included the Python extension. Got the basic Hello World example for tkinter going. (https://wiki.python.org/moin/TkInter)

**Thoughts:** It's easy to want to spend time setting up project boards and such when I just really need to stop and actually code something. Also, tkinter seems convenient, but maybe not the easiest to start with as far as a GUI. I might try something else later.

### Day 2: December 25

**Today's Progress**: Started connecting the GUI to the parser program. Figuring out not only how to import a module, but actually get it to run. Need to keep appending self. to functions and adding self as the first parameter of said functions.

**Thoughts**: Python classes/functions keep passing self in. I guess it doesn't want to be left out of anything. Also, these were helpful: [Digital Ocean link on modules](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-write-modules-in-python-3) and [Type Error](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18884782/typeerror-worker-takes-0-positional-arguments-but-1-was-given)

### Day 3: December 26

**Today's Progress**: Finished debugging/testing the GUI. It now fires the parser and works as before! Also got same-directory Output to work.

**Thoughts** Actually spent the full hour, instead of less than 30 mins like I was expecting. Next, I'll see about adding a Browse button/functionality to allow for custom input paths/files.

### Day 4: December 27

**Today's Progress**: Tinkered more with tkinter and getting an Entry box on the screen. Start back up on line 19, moving the other objects onto the Canvas.

**Thoughts** Tkinter is hard, but not terribly so.

### Day 5: December 28

**Today's Progress**: Got the Parse button onto the Canvas, added the Browse button. Got it working as a fileDialog process. Started work on getting this to flow into the Parser. Pick back up on line 165 next.

**Thoughts** Still don't understand tkinter wizardry, but at least this is more closely resembling a decent app. Comparing it in my mind to Royce's shape file parser, which could also be a good next project update idea to keep in mind.

### Day 6: December 29

**Today's Progress**: Got the file path field to properly pass the path on to the parser. With some more tweaks, we now have a fully working, albeit primitive version of the parser. There's still a lot of room for polish and updates, but at least someone could download this project and run it (provided they're on the latest version of Python). I also created a Release (v0.1.0) on GitHub.

**Thoughts** Even an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) takes a bit of work. At last now I feel I can move over to the New World Data Comparison project. Also, creating an actual Release feels pretty official.
