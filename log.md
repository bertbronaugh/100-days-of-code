# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: December 24, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Cloned the 100 Days of Code repo over to my Tyler personal profile. Set up basic projects for the IncHelpParser and BrazosNewWorldDataComparison repos. Getting the IncHelp project going on VS2019, which included the Python extension. Got the basic Hello World example for tkinter going. (https://wiki.python.org/moin/TkInter)

**Thoughts:** It's easy to want to spend time setting up project boards and such when I just really need to stop and actually code something. Also, tkinter seems convenient, but maybe not the easiest to start with as far as a GUI. I might try something else later.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday (Example)

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
